				<p>Humanity has been enslaved for 214 years. Nobody is allowed to leave their homes and every person is mysteriously kept alive by the PYRAMID.
					They watch the PYRAMID from their windows day and night. Time became irrelevant a century ago. They all answer to the PYRAMID who keeps them alive and healthy.
					Never too hungry or thirsty, confined in a small space for years and years and years. Most have already forgotten, but the PYRAMID was built in order to provide safety and comfort.
					The PYRAMID protected humanity from many dangers that would’ve made them extinct a long time ago. A supercomputer that watches over all and ensures the survival of humanity no matter what.
					However, the cost of safety may have been too high. Many have been driven to insanity. The ones who try to end their pain have only met with failure. Their time ends when the computer decides.</p>

				<p>You find yourself in front of the Great Pyramid that you have spent 2 centuries staring at. It is unlike anything you’ve ever imagined. You guess that it is hundreds of miles high but even that seems to be an underestimation. Upon closer
					inspection, you notice that it is made of a strange black metal, rusty in some parts. You can’t quite place the source of the sound but it seems that there is a faint buzz coming from somewhere inside the building. What do you do next? </p>

				<p>The texture is slimy and gross. It leaves a black stain on your finger and you can’t scrub it off. It also smells strange, like petrol mixed with lemon juice for some reason. You didn’t really gain anything from this other than a gross
					finger. What do you do next?</p>

				<p>You reach the dent in the wall and discover a trap door. It is not locked. You decide to go in. Taking one last look at the world behind you, you prepare for whatever awaits behind that door. After all, anything would be better than your
					life before. You descend down a narrow set of stairs. After what feels like forever, you can finally distinguish the end of the stairs. The room is dimly lit by neon lights that flicker from time to time. It takes a while for you to adjust
					with the lighting.</p>

				<p>The room is very spacious and cold. The floor is made of marble tiles that form a strange pattern. Portraits hang on the wall. They stare at you with piercing eyes, you feel like they follow you as you walk through the room. You blame it
					on your mind playing tricks on you. The room is in the shape of a pentagon. Four doors stand before you. </p>
